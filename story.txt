Once upon a time there was a boy named Git. You see, Git had a crazy dream,
and that dream was to become the next king of the coders. To do this, he had
to traverse the great sea of avl binary search tree, conquer its ruthless
rotations and constant rebalancing, in order to find the mysterious One Key.
Legend holds, the one who posseses the One Key has the value to rule over all 
code.

However, Git was not successful in his search. Instead of finding The One Key, he found
a two key. He went to ask the wise wizard what this key was. 
  "It's the two key! Any useful binary search tree can store multiple keys, after all."
The wizard explained.
  "Thanks, but I still would prefer the one key," The Git responded.

"And I would prefer to be talking to Sharon Stone", the wizard grumbled, "but even as a wizard that's not a reasonable..." His voice trailed off as if reconsidering what he was about to say, then he came to his senses. "If you want the one key, try the left child of the two key. That's the only place it could be, unless it dropped down the side of the car seat again".

Tired of the wizard's ramblings, he thanked him for his wisdom and turned to leave.  As Git walked away, the wizard exclaimed, "Don't forget to check the nu..." but his voice was lost to the wind. Git was eager to finally finish his quest and hastily checked that value of the left child of the two key. At that moment time stopped. The world began to shine a bright white light and he closed his eyes preparing for his demise. A few moments passed. Git opened his eyes realizing what he had done. There was not a sight nor sound in existence. Everything around him was nothing but white.
